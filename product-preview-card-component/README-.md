### Built with

### What I learned

In this mobile-first priority project, I used Flexbox. When I switched to the desktop version, it was enough to change the flexbox alignment properties and some dimensions. It was very enjoyable to consolidate my CSS knowledge by doing this kind of work on alignment with Flexbox.
